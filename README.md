# Applications
A repository designed to help jr. Cog Creators apply for beta and approved list membership. 

# Getting Started
The first thing you should do is fork this repository. It contains all the vital information, [rules](http://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_cog_how_to_publish/), and formatting for publishing your own repository. Now you can begin work on your own cogs by experiementing and altering the examples. We have included three examples to help get you started. If you get stuck we are here to help! Please check out our [Resources](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Applications/blob/master/README.md#resources) and [FAQ](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Applications/blob/master/README.md#faq) sections. If you are still stuck, feel free to come chat with us in #coding on the Red Discord Server.

Yup that's it. Once you are on the beta list, you will be given your own support channel in [Red - Cog Support Server](https://discord.gg/waChvjH).



Should you get stuck we are here to help. Please check out our [Resources](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Applications/blob/master/README.md#resources) and [FAQ](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Applications/blob/master/README.md#faq) sections for more information on this

# Designing Your Repository
Your readme will design a page just like the one you are reading right now! This page should contain information about your repository, requirements, installation insructions, and how to contact you if users recieve issues with your cogs. Remember, this is your repository! It should reflect who you are as a cog creator, but also contain vital information to your community.

You are not required to have a wiki page, but as your creations grow in complexity they may need their own dedicated page. You can create a wiki page on your repository at anytime, but is not subject to scrutiny for beta list applications.  
# Ready for Publishing
Once you feel that your cogs meet the requirements for applying to beta list(See approved applications for approved list) create a pull request to this repo from your forked one. This allows us to check all the changes, and conduct code reviews for your submitted cogs.
### Creating the Pull Request
The pull request comment body should contain this format:  
List: [approved/beta]

Repository name:

Author:

Description:

Deviation from this format will only slow down your application process. 
### Team Reviews
We have two teams that will review your code. A review team, which will mark things for you to clean-up in your code, in your repository, and checks if everything works. The second team is a security team that will look to make sure your code does not contain harmful vulnerabilities or contain malicious content meant to harm other users. Once both teams have given their seals of approval, Twentysix will conduct a final review of your application to determine if it will be added to the beta list.
### Making Changes
You may have an in-line comment which will ask you to change certain parts of your code. You may also have a comment on the PR from a team member asking you to change large parts, or ask for clarification. Please respond to these changes swiftly so each team can continue to review your code.
# Final Approval
Finally once both teams have decided that the application passes inspection, it will be reviewed by Twentysix. The whole point of this process is for senior Cog Creators to weed out bad applications, and strengthen weak applications with good potential. Twentysix judges not just the repository, but the creator as well. How well did you respond to criticism? Did your creativity bring something refreshing to the bot? Are you quick to adapt and make changes? If there are good awnsers to these questions, then you will likely be approved. Welcome to the fold.
# Approved List
Submission to this list requires that you are at least on the beta list and you are in good standing with the community. This is more than just a list for your repo. You are joining the ranks of Cog Creators. You will be expected to help jr. Cog Creators in the same way we helped you. Your repo should be in tip-top shape and bring unique features to the community. There will be a much stricter review process for these types of applications, so please be patient when waiting for approval. Once approved you will be granted the Cog Creator role in both Red servers, and will be allowed to submit cogs for weekly spotlights on the main server.
# FAQ
###I submitted my application a whole hour ago! Why hasn't someone said anything???  
Whoa. Slow down there cowboy. We all have lives, and do this in our spare time. Give us sometime. Impatience will not expedite the review process.

###These changes seem petty. Why do I have to make them?
Standards. At a minimum your code should not look like week old spaghetti. We are less critical of beta list applications, because we understand you are still in the learning process. Approved list applications will recieve much higher scrutiny, because of the respect and perks that it garners. 

###How long does this application process take?
Really depends on how free of errors and clean your code is when submitted. Even if you are 1337blackhathaxor we still have to take the time to properly test your work, and vet it. Following our comments, guidelines, and responding positively is the fastest way to have an application approved.

###Why was my application denied?
Any number of reasons could result in an application denial. We don't want to flood the community with the same stuff over and over. Check out other repos and see if you are doing the same thing. If you do it better, explain why. We don't want to remove choices from the community, but we also don't want to give so many choices that they can't find anything good. Applications where the creator refuses to work or communicate peacefully does not fit the image we what we want in a creator.

###I went to #coding and they basically told me to GTFO/ or didn't respond
Did you do any research prior to asking your question. Did you try to at least do a simple google search? Did you read the docs? Did you accurately describe your problem, and show your work? We are not here to simply provide you an answer out of convience. Everyone is much more willing to help if we can see that you are trying and are struggling and the answer is not obvious. Also if google finds the answer you owe irdumb two cookies.

###Can I advertise my repo in the server while waiting for approval to beta list?
No. One of the key points of this process is to make sure your repo is ready to be opened up to the community in an offical capacity. Advertising your repo or cogs in the main Red Bot Server or Red - Cog Support server will get your pee pee smacked. Don't do it.

###Can I submit more than three cogs?
Yes, but understand that this will significantly increase the time required to approve your repo, because we now need to review and test additional code.

###Well I'll just slip in haxx360noscope6969.py after approval hueueuhue
Don't do that. Your PR remains open after approval, and we can see changes added to your repo. Big Brother is watching you.
