# Red Bot Cog Creators
This organization is a community of Red Bot content creators. We are working towards mentoring and helping those who wish to contribute to the Red Bot project created by TwentySix. This repository will serve as a gateway and communication hub in conjunction with the Red - Discord Bot and Red - Cog Support discord servers. Please read the information below to get started on the process of becoming a cog creator.

1. [Cog-Making Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) - If you want to learn how to make cogs, please follow this step-by-step tutorial that'll get your feet wet while getting your repo all set up and ready to publish!
2. [Application Process](APPLYING.md) - If you already know how to make cogs or are now ready to start publishing your repo, you should now read through the application process!
3. Stay Connected with the community - This repo is under construction and is only maintained with volunteered time. Make sure you [read the docs](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/) and join the [Official Red server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh)  [<img src="https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/133049272517001216/widget.png?style=shield">](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) and [Cog Support server](https://discord.gg/GET4DVk) [<img src="https://ptb.discordapp.com/api/guilds/240154543684321280/widget.png?style=shield">](https://discord.gg/GET4DVk) to stay in the loop!

# FAQ
###I submitted my application a whole hour ago! Why hasn't someone said anything???  
Whoa. Slow down there cowboy. We all have lives, and do this in our spare time. Give us sometime. Impatience will not expedite the review process.

###These changes seem petty. Why do I have to make them?
Standards. At a minimum your code should not look like week old spaghetti. We are less critical of beta list applications, because we understand you are still in the learning process. Approved list applications will recieve much higher scrutiny, because of the respect and perks that it garners. 

###How long does this application process take?
Really depends on how free of errors and clean your code is when submitted. Even if you are 1337blackhathaxor we still have to take the time to properly test your work, and vet it. Following our comments, guidelines, and responding positively is the fastest way to have an application approved.

###Why was my application denied?
Any number of reasons could result in an application denial. We don't want to flood the community with the same stuff over and over. Check out other repos and see if you are doing the same thing. If you do it better, explain why. We don't want to remove choices from the community, but we also don't want to give so many choices that they can't find anything good. Applications where the creator refuses to work or communicate peacefully does not fit the image we what we want in a creator.

###I went to #coding and they basically told me to GTFO/ or didn't respond
Did you do any research prior to asking your question. Did you try to at least do a simple google search? Did you read the docs? Did you accurately describe your problem, and show your work? We are not here to simply provide you an answer out of convience. Everyone is much more willing to help if we can see that you are trying and are struggling and the answer is not obvious. Also if google finds the answer you owe irdumb two cookies.

###Can I advertise my repo in the server while waiting for approval to beta list?
No. We encourage you to share your code and create meaningful discussions; however, advertising your repo for people to download your cogs in the main server defeats the purpose of applying to the beta list. Having someone to help test your work is fine, and we *want* you to have people help test and give you feedback. That's what makes an ok cog a *great* cog.

###Can I submit more than three cogs?
Yes, but understand that this will significantly increase the time required to approve your repo, because we now need to review and test additional code.

###Well I'll just slip in haxx360noscope6969.py after approval hueueuhue
Don't do that. Your PR remains open after approval, and we can see changes added to your repo. Big Brother is watching you.
